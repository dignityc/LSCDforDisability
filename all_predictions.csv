He told me that when your executive functions are working as they should, they help filter out automatic thoughts and you have more ability to focus on something other than unproductive lines of thinking. That's why medication helps. And like you, when my medication is working, my negative self-talk is so, so much better. It's not always perfect, but it helps.

That's the physical and medication side of this. Another part of my treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This deals with automatic thoughts by attacking them head on and evaluating them objectively. It's more complicated than this, but I am just starting here and recommend you look into this, as well.

That's why medication helps. And like you, when my medication is working, my negative self-talk is so, so much better. It's not always perfect, but it helps.

That's the physical and medication side of this. Another part of my treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

He told me that when your executive functions are working as they should, they help filter out automatic thoughts and you have more ability to focus on something other than unproductive lines of thinking. That's why medication helps. And like you, when my medication is working, my negative self-talk is so, so much better. It's not always perfect, but it helps.

That's the physical and medication side of this. Another part of my treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This deals with automatic thoughts by attacking them head on and evaluating them objectively. It's more complicated than this, but I am just starting here and recommend you look into this, as well.

He told me that when your executive functions are working as they should, they help filter out automatic thoughts and you have more ability to focus on something other than unproductive lines of thinking. That's why medication helps. And like you, when my medication is working, my negative self-talk is so, so much better. It's not always perfect, but it helps.

That's the physical and medication side of this. Another part of my treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This deals with automatic thoughts by attacking them head on and evaluating them objectively. It's more complicated than this, but I am just starting here and recommend you look into this, as well.

He told me that when your executive functions are working as they should, they help filter out automatic thoughts and you have more ability to focus on something other than unproductive lines of thinking. That's why medication helps. And like you, when my medication is working, my negative self-talk is so, so much better. It's not always perfect, but it helps.

That's the physical and medication side of this. Another part of my treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This deals with automatic thoughts by attacking them head on and evaluating them objectively. It's more complicated than this, but I am just starting here and recommend you look into this, as well.

54,"I do the same. I'm from Germany and I'm tired of being harrassed and insulted for just existing. Bureaucracy for all kinds of things is nuts here as well when you're disabled. 

I graduated from school with honours, I study one of the most prestigious majors in this country, I do my part for society, I'm still treated like a second class citizen. I just want to leave.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,Disability,9
55,"I'm pretty deaf and I have daily struggles connecting/communicating with people. It's very isolating. Fucks you in the head a lot.
Edited to add: often can't go see movies, miss announcements on transit, video content on websites is often inaccessible, people think I'm ignoring them or dumb.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,Disability,9

59,"This entire thread is so useful I'm getting so many amazing replies.

The fingerless gloves is a cool tip as the character is a bit of a punk anyway. Getting ones with thumbs would be good though. As for the rest of the wardrobe, would you believe that before I made this post and saw heaps of replys saying why it's obviously dumb my initial concept had her in a long coat and skinny jeans -_- while I'm on the topic are skinny jeans even close to viable? I'd imagine not now that I've thought about it. So many things to revise :P at least I got the side bag on the lap right. I can see her getting a comfy cussion though, not too concerned about making it look like a polished version of life, more interested in presenting it how it looks.

There was another post talking about type of chair, looking at the lighter models for sure. Hospital ones look grossly inadequate. I also see the character wanting to use her arms and being kinda poor anyway so manual seems the go.

Lots of opportunity for growth there though, lots of skills to learn. I may use a few quotes from you as advice from a friend if that's okay?",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Disability,9
